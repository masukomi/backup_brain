# Backup Brain's Vision
Bookmarks are just the start!

## The Things We'll Store
The goal is to ingest - or create copies of - all sorts of things, and make them easy to find in one central place. I want us to be able to "just search" and find "that thing" without having to remember what service or tool we were using when we encountered it.

I'd like to teach it how to watch your Mastodon (or similar) account and make copies of all the Toots you "Bookmark".

Maybe store copies of all the web sites you've visited, creating a personal search engine of all the things you've seen.

Other cool stuff we haven't thought of yet. If you've got an idea, feel free to [make a new issue describing it](https://github.com/masukomi/backup_brain/issues).

Regardless of what we add to it down the road, all of it will be optional, under your control, and never shared. Well, _you_ can choose to share things. The software will never choose to do it for you. 


## Easier installation
Spinning installing & configuring all the components is pretty geeky right now. I want this to be something non-geeks can install easily.

Here's some things I'd like to make a reality.

- "One-click" installs at hosting providers like Digital Ocean
- Raspberry Pi images
- Offer Raspberry Pis for sale that are pre-configured and just need to be plugged in to your network. 

## What's next?
I've got a lot of enhancements planned. The [ticket tracker](https://github.com/masukomi/backup_brain/issues) is the best place to see what's coming in the near term.
