# Contributing to Backup Brain
## Community Notes
Black Lives Matter. 
Trans Lives matter. 
Trans kids deserve protecting. 
Queer people are beautiful.

If you don't whole-heartedly agree with these statements I don't
want your contributions.


## Making Contributions
If you're cool with the above, then I'd be thrilled to have your contributions added to Backup Brain.

Graphical improvements to the CSS and HTML are greatly appreciated, but please don't make any dramatic changes to the look and feel without opening an issue to discuss it first. I don't want you to feel you've wasted your time.

The [issues page](https://github.com/masukomi/backup_brain/issues) has 
the latest list of features I'm actively looking to add or bugs I need to fix.

If you're interested in adding something completely different, please make sure it's in line with the Vision of this project. If you're unsure, just file a ticket and see what other user's think.

See the VISION.md document for more details.

### Graphics Folks
There is an "orphan" branch called `graphical_resources` that contains a `resources` directory with Affinity Designer files for all of the images used in this app. 

There is also a `screenshots` directory where you should store any new / updated screenshots needed for the README or other documentation.

## Faster Responses
GitHub notifications are a firehose I'm having trouble taming. Giving me a heads-up about your PR or Issue is _very_ helpful. If you're on the fediverse please message me at [@masukomi@connectified.com](https://connectified.com/@masukomi) or email me at [masukomi@masukomi.org](mailto:masukomi@masukomi.org) and put "Backup Brain" in the title. I'm not spectacular at email, but I'll try to read it in a timely manner.

## Copyright Transfer
The Pull Request template contains a required copyright transfer section. PRs won't be accepted without an authorized copyright transfer. 

There are two reasons for this: 
1. I don't want to have to track down every contributor if a license change is needed in the future.
2. As this project evolves, I may want to set it up as a public bookmarking service so that people don't have to self-host it to use it. I'm also thinking about selling Raspberry Pi's with everything pre-installed for non-geeks.
