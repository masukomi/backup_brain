# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
/mongo_exports/*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep
# don't need to track temp cache stuff either
/tmp/cache/*

/lib/.precomp/*

/public/assets

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key

# Why Apple? Why?!
.DS_Store

# Why Affinity Why?
*~lock~
